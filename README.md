# WpfUi.Avalonia

The inspiration for this project was taken from https://github.com/lepoco/wpfui, I liked the look of it and wanted to
port it over to Avalonia.

This is a heavy WIP and i would appreciate any PR's that come my way, there is a demo app which will allow you to see
the current controls, I plan to update the demo app and publish it separately into the releases section when we have a
few more controls.

You can also checkout what im working on here https://trello.com/b/32liR7gY/avaloniawpfui if you would like to work on
anything and like it checked off let me know :).
